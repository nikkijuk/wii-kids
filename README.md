experimets dads do - how to set up child friendly wii

## disclaimer

currently this is all theory -- i'm preparing myself

## goal: games without dvd media

ever tried to get kids to be careful with dvd's -- yep -- it goes all well until some point

so: my goal is to make backup of each game we have, and copy them to harddrive - problem: how to make backups, how to load games from backup media

it seems that wii has been loved and cared console, so there's lot of utilities to help

## Important questions: is this legal?

YES. Softmodding a Wii is perfectly legal. Pirating games however IS illegal. Know the difference.

## making backups : wii backup manager

I need to get image out of dvd's and see that it's copied to format and device that wii is able to see

but this seems to be only part of story - for ripping something else is also needed

## support for history: emulators

I'm not going to details yet, but be sure of it: games from old nintendo consoles can be used with wii. 

Gamecube support is here
